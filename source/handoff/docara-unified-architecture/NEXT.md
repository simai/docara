# Next action: execute Goal 1 Portable Smart Runtime

The user explicitly postponed any live action and authorized Goal 1 from
`source/workflow/2026-08-02-docara-extensible-lego-architecture-plan.md`.
The active recovery source is now
`source/workflow/2026-08-02-docara-goal1-portable-smart-runtime.md`; the next
safe batch is G1.1 after the separate G1.0 baseline commit.

Do not touch `docara-new.test`, `docara.test` or external Framework repositories.
Do not start Goal 2/3, merge, push, tag, release or deploy. Stop for independent
audit only after all Goal 1 Done When rows have fresh evidence.

## Historical deployment decision (parked)

The deterministic R2 correction and complete disposable retest pass. The live
site is unchanged. There is now one exact unpublished candidate and one
remaining production decision.

The same exact candidate is deployed for user validation at
`https://docara-new.test`. Its 103/103 route smoke, static verification and
representative browser interactions pass. This test deployment does not open
the separate `docara.test` production gate.

## Current correction target

The former source `56a2abf8…`, ZIP `04c18c95…` and tree `457790d4…` are
`superseded_after_determinism_audit`; they must not be tagged or deployed.

## Completed proof

- correction workflow:
  `source/workflow/2026-08-02-docara-r2-determinism-correction.md`;
- exact evidence:
  `source/workflow/evidence/2026-08-02-docara-r2-determinism-correction/INDEX.md`;
- two clean-clone packages and two dist consumers are byte-identical;
- macOS PHP 8.4/8.3 and Linux PHP 8.3, security, browser/HTTP,
  current/candidate delta and disposable cutover/rollback pass;
- live boundary: `/Users/rim/Sites/docara.test` is read-only throughout R2.

## Historical artifacts

| Artifact | Source | ZIP SHA-256 | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M5 product candidate | `48751b8…` | `d12169b…` | historical bounded M5 evidence only |
| Rejected R1 candidate | `8c0d145…` | `83afd355…` | `superseded_after_audit`; immutable negative baseline |
| Rejected rc.2 candidate | `56a2abf8…` | `04c18c95…` | `superseded_after_determinism_audit`; immutable negative baseline |

## Parked live action

The previous next action was to choose `deploy` or `do not deploy` for the rc.3
candidate. It remains historical and unauthorized while Goal 1 changes product
source. Any future deployment requires a new exact candidate and fresh dossier.

No merge, push, tag, publication, release or live deployment is authorized.
